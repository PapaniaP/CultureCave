## About Culture Cave

Culture Cave is an exam project that I undertook to showcase the lesser-known gems of Verona. The project encompassed various stages, from initial research and concept sketches to design and development.

### Research Phase

#### Desk Research

The research phase began with desk research to gather insights into the hidden gems of Verona. This involved studying online resources, articles, and reviews to identify potential locations of interest.

#### Interviewing Business Owners and Potential Users

To gain deeper insights and firsthand knowledge, I conducted interviews with local business owners and potential users. These interviews helped in understanding the unique features of these hidden gems and their appeal to the target audience.

#### Creating Interview Guides

To ensure structured and meaningful interviews, I created interview guides that covered various aspects, such as the history of the location, customer experiences, and local recommendations.

### Design Phase

During the design phase, I utilized Adobe XD to create the project's visual layout and user interface. This step involved creating the website's structure and determining the user experience.

### Development Phase

The development phase involved coding the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I implemented various features, such as a navigation menu, search functionality, and content showcasing Verona's hidden gems.

## Known Issues

While Culture Cave represents a significant achievement, it's important to acknowledge some known issues:

- **Scroll to Top Button:** The scroll to top button is currently non-functional.
- **Sticky Navigation:** Due to the scroll-to-top issue, the navigation menu is now sticky to ensure usability.
- **Search Functionality:** The search functionality is not operational at the moment.
- **Mobile Navigation:** The mobile navigation/menu is currently not functioning as intended.
- **Image Carousel:** The image carousel was implemented using CSS and JS in a few different ways to which none of them functioned as intended.
